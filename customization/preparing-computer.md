Mapeo is built with JavaScript programming language. To get started, you'll need to install[ Node.js ](https://nodejs.org)development environment.. If you already have Node.js installed you can skip this section.

You need to be at least on Node.js version 8 \(or higher\) for the mapeo-settings-builder to work properly. Head over to [Node.js download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) page and select installer for your operating system.

Alternatively you can also use NVM \(Node Version Manager\) to install and manage multiple versions of Node.js on your computer.

curl -o- <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.32.1/install.sh> | bash

```sh
npm install -g mapeo-settings-builder
```
